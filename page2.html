    <p>I was born in Kathmandu (the capital of Nepal) on 12th of Jan 2010. Later I moved to another city called Butwal.
        I lived there for 8 years. i don't have any siblings. I am the only child of my parents.
        I have been living in Berlin since August 2023. I am currently studying at Canisius College in the 9th grade.
        I can speak Nepali, English, Hindi and a good amount of German. I am interested in technology, especially in programming and web development.
        I enjoy playing video games and listening to music in my free time.
